Nebula Introducing local privilege escalation in Linux
About
Nebula takes the participant through a variety of common (and less than common) weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Linux. It takes a look at

SUID files
Permissions
Race conditions
Shell meta-variables
$PATH weaknesses
Scripting language weaknesses
Binary compilation failures
At the end of Nebula, the user will have a reasonably thorough understanding of local attacks against Linux systems, and a cursory look at some of the remote attacks that are possible.

Getting started
Virtual Machine Image
Please see the <a href="http://exploit-exercises.com/h/ovf">OVF</a> help page for how to use the file with your virtualisation products.

Levels
Have a look at the levels available on the side bar, and log into the virtual machine as the username "levelXX" with a password of "levelXX" (without quotes), where XX is the level number.

Some levels can be done purely remotely.

Getting root
In case you need root access to change stuff (such as key mappings, etc), you can do the following:

Log in as the "nebula" user account with the password "nebula" (both without quotes), followed by "sudo -s" with the password "nebula". You'll then have root privileges in order to change whatever needs to be changed.
