# These options can be used to specify how to parse and compare page

[Detection]

# Level of tests to perform.

# Note: boolean-based blind SQL injection tests with AND are considered

[Techniques]

# SQL injection techniques to test for.
# Valid: a string composed by B, E, U, S and T where:
# B: Boolean-based blind SQL injection
# E: Error-based SQL injection
# U: UNION query SQL injection
# S: Stacked queries SQL injection
# T: Time-based blind SQL injection
# Example: ES (means test for error-based and stacked queries SQL
# injection types only)
# Default: BEUST (means test for all SQL injection types - recommended)

# Valid: integer
# Default: 5

# 5: Show also HTTP responses' headers
# 6: Show also HTTP responses' page content
# Default: 1
