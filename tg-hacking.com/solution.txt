	this will have a link (http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/sdrawkcab.htm) to click.
	when click, it displays the same pop-up but it will redirect back immediately if click cancel, or wrong password
	The solution is either disable javascript for this page to disable redirect back, or download the page to read source code.
		curl http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/sdrawkcab.htm
	The source code will have this line
		if (pass=="superdoo") {
	so,
	pwd = superdoo

6: http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/save_as.htm
	view source and see the line
		<SCRIPT SRC="psswd.js" LANGUAGE="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
	download that psswd.js file to see the code inside

	see javascript source code, 
		pw=String.fromCharCode(116,103,104,97,99,75);
	use javascript to convert to type-able string
	pw = tghacK

10: http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/YZOaA.php
	read between <i>..</i> and construct string from it (all in lowercase)
	pwd = shackithalf
	it would say some error, just ignore it and Ctrl+A to highlight screen to see next level

11: http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/hahaha.php
	highlight screen using Ctrl+A to see hidden word
		base 64 decrypt and add .php hahaha grean eWVhdGdO decrypt
	using base64 decoder to decrypt 'eWVhdGdO' to be 'yeatgN'
	It supposes to be 'yeatgN.php', but it's actually 'http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/yeatgh.php'

	but looking in the folder that contains logo.png
	found /images/love.png 
	which after download and open with text-editor, it says 'omfg.php' which is level 14

12: http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/yeatgh.php
	view source and read between <i>..</i>, it reads, encrypt with base64 atom128
	and from hint KJ0IpxStLoL4+Hh3fiB1+GJqgirTM5PkK4TipgBgDj0XiGh3fiB2MhBogy6MiGuZ
	decrypt it with atom128 (e.g. from http://crypo.in.ua/tools/eng_atom128c.php)
	will get, cGFzc3dvcmQlMjAlM0QlMjB5b3VyJTIwaXAlMjBhZGRyZXNz
	and decrypt that with base64
	will get, 
		password = your ip address
	enter your own ip address (get it from http://ifconfig.me/ip) in the text box and submit
	It'd says "wrong", but Ctrl+A to highlight and see the next level

13:	http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/ghost.php
	it has a broken image on the page, with the tag 
		<img src="love.png" alt="Smiley face" height="42" width="42">
	download the image (/images/love.png) and open it with text editor (notepad, gedit, vim)
	and next level is inside

14: http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/omfg.php
	when the text box is disabled, make it enable by either using Chrome debugger or javascript
		document.forms[0].elements[0].disabled=false
	type in the password 'hotbabe' and submit

15: http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/superman.php
	it says, in php, it displays something like $_GET['password']|$password
	what if we input '$password'
	since it doesn't allow to type longer than 5 chars, inject it in URL
	getting 
	pwd = supermaniscool
	try the password to get to next page

16: http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/ipm0.php
	it says IP doesn't match with what in the hidden field.
	So, change the IP in the hidden field to be our own IP (see it from http://ifconfig.me)
	and press "Show Message" to submit

17: http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/bananasplit.php
	it says A=bypass on the page
	Since it looks like a variable 'A', put it as a GET parameter, like this
		http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/bananasplit.php?A=bypass
	The new page will not have the word "password is wrong" anymore.
	instead, Ctrl+A to reveal a word "megan35feron74"
	Spliting in half, it says megan35 and feron74. Both are encoding algorithm
	So we have the broken iframe tag with URL like a crypted word 'PvsNNuynDcDg8nOhPusyRzlWucT4'
	apply Feron-74 decoder first(http://crypo.in.ua/tools/eng_feron74d.php), 
	then Megan-35 decoder(http://crypo.in.ua/tools/eng_megan35c.php),
	will see the plain text which is 
		chocosundae.php
	
	go to http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/chocosundae.php
	It says 'A password will be displayed after your HTTP UA is "TGH".'
	Change your 'User-Agent' header = 'TGH' using add-on on Firefox, or curl -A and open the old page again with A=bypass
		curl -A 'TGH' 'http://hackertest.tg-hacking.com/bananasplit.php?A=bypass'
	see the password
		password = l17c
	type in 'l17c' and submit, the next page appears
